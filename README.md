# Welcome to Druidia, a MUD built with Evennia.

Do not expect anything here.  This is just something I'm playing with.  The game is not publicly hosted.  As of March 2022 Druidia is hosted on an emulated Raspberry Pi on an old laptop for development.

Druidia is inspired by Star Wars: Galactic Dominion, a MUD I played most often, back when I played MUDs a long time ago.  SW:GD is defunct but it had some features I really enjoyed, such as the ability to make armor and weapons and buying ships and droids.

I do not want Druidia tied to the Star Wars intellectual property.  Instead, the setting of Druidia is a post-apocalyptic future.  However, I will try to leverage the many elements of the pop culture I experienced growing up.  Some of the big influences beside Star Wars include Judge Dredd, Star Trek, Stephen King’s Dark Tower series and too many other references to mention.  The astute reader and film fan will recognize the name Druidia.

Mechanically, I want character classes, the ability to craft equipment such as armor, weapons, ships, and droids.  The droids are intended to be persistent pets that help you along your journey.

So, I’m starting with humble beginnings.  The player character comes to in a cold, steel apartment.  It’s time to get going, but where to?  Somewhere in the space above, an intergalactic trade battle drags on, keeping races below marred in poverty.

I’m just entertaining myself here.  Pay no mind.  -Tiogaplanet
