# LightSource
#
# This object emits light. Once it has been turned on it
# cannot be turned off. When it burns out it will delete
# itself.
#
# This could be implemented using a single-repeat Script or by
# registering with the TickerHandler. We do it simpler by
# using the delay() utility function. This is very simple
# to use but does not survive a server @reload. Because of
# where the light matters (in the Dark Room where you can
# find new light sources easily), this is okay here.
